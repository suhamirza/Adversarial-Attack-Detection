# Adversarial-Attack-Detection
A real-time detection system designed to identify adversarial attacks targeting AI models. This project demonstrates the creation of a secure AI system by training a neural network, generating adversarial examples using the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), and implementing a robust detection mechanism.

## Features
Neural Network Training: A simple yet effective neural network trained on the MNIST dataset.

Real-Time Detection System: A mechanism to detect adversarial inputs in real time, enhancing the modelâ€™s cybersecurity.
